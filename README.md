## Clayton Cohn, Caitlin Snyder, Justin Montenegro, and Gautam Biswas

This repository contains the supplementary materials for Vanderbilt OELE Lab's submission to AIED24 Late-Breaking Results. This is a copy of the supplemental materials repository found at: [https://github.com/oele-isis-vanderbilt/AIED24_LBR](https://github.com/oele-isis-vanderbilt/AIED24_LBR). 

There are five supplements, which are enumerated below:

1. **C2STEM Learning Environment.pdf** — Additional details about our C2STEM learning environment.
2. **Final Prompt.txt** — The final prompt we used for testing after the Method was applied.
3. **LLM Strengths, Weaknesses, and Trade-offs.pdf** — Additional findings on the LLM's strengths and weaknesses that we were unable to include in the manuscript due to brevity.
4. **Method Application Details.pdf** — A detailed explanation of why each component of our prompt was included and the accompanying design decisions that we made throughout the process (e.g., our few-shot instance selection methodology).
5. **Teacher Feedback.pdf** — An extended look at our conversation with the Educator.
